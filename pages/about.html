            After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the
            Bootcamp to get even more hands-on with my Solo Projects and meet like-minded peers.

        <p class="section-text">
          I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create
          simple
          projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my
          journey
          with the world.

      <section class="blog-content-section" aria-labelledby="getting-started-heading">
        <h2 class="section-title" id="getting-started-heading">How I got started</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
          started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning.
          After each
          learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of
          what I learned
          using my own words.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping
          others learn and
          stay motivated.

              <p class="blog-excerpt">I used to struggle with consistency in learning frontend, but discovering Scrimba
                was
                a game-changer.The
                interactive format made learning feel less like a chore and more adventure.</p>

              <p class="blog-excerpt">Discipline has always been my biggest challenge. But with Scrimba’s project-based
                path, I started waking up excited to code. Seeing my progress through actual projects, not just theory,
                helped me build a routine I never thought I could stick to.</p>

              <h3 class="blog-title">From Copy-Paste to Confidence</h3>
              <p class="blog-excerpt">In the beginning, I relied a lot on copying code without fully understanding it.
                But
                Scrimba’s challenges pushed me to pause, think, and break down each problem. Slowly, I started writing
                more
                from memory—and with confidence.</p>
