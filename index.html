          <p class="blog-excerpt">Discipline has always been my biggest challenge. But with Scrimba’s project-based
            path, I started waking up excited to code. Seeing my progress through actual projects, not just theory,

          <p class="blog-excerpt">In the beginning, I relied a lot on copying code without fully understanding it. But
            Scrimba’s challenges pushed me to pause, think, and break down each problem. Slowly, I started writing more
            from memory—and with confidence.</p>

          <p class="blog-excerpt">I'll never forget the moment I built my first responsive layout from scratch. It
